## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- @mixin

### What I learned

In this project I focused on the css grid, which is a gear when I should manipulate a lot of elements of course in certain situation CSS grid helps create a responsive design.
If necessary with CSS Grid  it is enough to specify the location by using grid-row and grid-column properties of an element without thinking about html.
